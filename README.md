* [Use of Autoclave: Sterilization by moist heat](https://awesomeveterinary.blogspot.com/p/blog-page_13.html) - Microbial population is often controlled by the use of physical and chemical agents. Chemical agents includes various disinfectants and antiseptics. While physical agents such as temperature, osmotic pressure and radiations (gamma rays, cathode rays, X-rays and ultraviolet rays).
* [Use of hot air oven dry heat sterilization](https://awesomeveterinary.blogspot.com/p/use-of-hot-air-oven-dry-heat.html) - Equipments like laboratory glassware and metal ware are usually sterilized by hot air oven. It can produce upto 200°C temperature. For sterilization 171°C is used for 20-30 min. Dry heat usually destroys microbes by oxidation of their proteins and ultimately incineration.
* [Culture media](https://awesomeveterinary.blogspot.com/p/blog-page_79.html) - A culture media is the mixture of organic and inorganic substances in which microorganisms are grown. While the culture is any deliberate growth or cultivation of microorganisms in the laboratory.
* [Preparation of the culture media](https://awesomeveterinary.blogspot.com/p/preparation-of-culture-media.html) - Culture media are commercially available in dehydrated form. These contain all the ingredients required in exact proportion. We have to only rehydrate the media, according to the instructions of the manufacturers. These are sterilized and dispensed into test tubes and petri plates as required for the experimentation. Some of the well known manufacturers of the media are Oxoid Ltd (UK), BDH (UK), Merck (Germany), Sigma (USA), Difco corporation (USA), and BioM (USA).
* [Preparation of Bacterial Smear](https://awesomeveterinary.blogspot.com/p/preparation-of-bacterial-smear.html) - To study the microorganisms and their characteristic, we need a pure culture. A pure culture contains only a single kind of microorganisms. To obtain pure culture varius techniques can be adopted.
* [Simple staining](https://awesomeveterinary.blogspot.com/p/simple-staining.html) - In the simple staining bacterial smear is stained with a single reagent, which produce distinctive contrast between an organism and its background. Basic stains with a positively charged chromogen are preferred because bacterial nuclei and cell wall are negatively charged. That charge will ultimately result in a strong binding with the positively charged chromogen. Purpose of staining is to visualize the morphology and arrangement of the bacterial cells.
* [Negative staining](https://awesomeveterinary.blogspot.com/p/negative-staining.html) - Negative staining require the use of an acidic stain such as India ink or nigrosin. The acidic stain is a negatively charged chromogen that cannot penetrate into bacterial cell due to the negative charge on the surface of bacterial cells. Therefore, unstained cells are easily visible against the colored background. Negative stain has two advantages. First, as heat fixation is not done and the cells are not subjected to any chemical or heat distortion so we can observe natural shape and size of bacterial cells. Secondly, we can easily observe the bacterial cells that are difficult to visualize.
* [Gram's staining](https://awesomeveterinary.blogspot.com/p/gram-staining.html) - It is the most common technique used in microbiology for differential staining. It is named after its inventor Dr. Christian Gram.
* [Capsule staining](https://awesomeveterinary.blogspot.com/p/capsule-staining.html) - Capsule staining is more difficult than other types of differential staining procedures because the capsular material are water soluble and may be dislodged and removed by vigorous washing.
* [Acid fast staining](https://awesomeveterinary.blogspot.com/p/acid-fast-staining.html) - The majority of the bacteria are stainable with simple or gram staining. While few cannot be stained with these techniques, e.g. Mycobacterium and Neisseria. For these specialized techniques is used called acid fast staining.
* [Flageller staining](https://awesomeveterinary.blogspot.com/p/flagellar-staining.html) - Flagella are long  thin appendages that helps the bacteria for motility. They are so thin that can not be visualized by simple microscope. To make they visible, they are thicked by an extra coating over them by the use of mordants. For flagella staining best is to use fresh young culture.
* [Spore staining](https://awesomeveterinary.blogspot.com/p/spore-staining.html) - Bacterial endospores formed by the genera Clostridium and Bacillus possess remarkable resistance to physical and chemical agents. Spore do not absorb the stain easily but once stained it does not lose it easily. Heat is applied to force the spores to get stain. When cooled the will not lose it even when during washing. These remarkable features are due to presence of dipicolinic acid.
* [Examination of bacterial motility](https://awesomeveterinary.blogspot.com/p/examination-of-bacterial-motility.html) - Bacteria due to their small size and refractive index close to water, are very difficult to visualize in an unstained state. Live examination is however useful to observe cells motility.
8 [Cultivation of fungi](https://awesomeveterinary.blogspot.com/p/cultivation-of-fungi.html) - Molds are the major fungal organisms that can be seen by the naked eye. These can be commonly seen growing on the foods such as bread or citrus fruits. These grow as cottony fuzzy, black, green or orange colored depending on the type of molds.
* [Identification of filamentous fungi ](https://awesomeveterinary.blogspot.com/p/blog-page_78.html) - In this section, you can get information about the identification of fungi.
* [Slide culture technique of fungi](https://awesomeveterinary.blogspot.com/p/slide-culture-technique-of-fungi.html) - As the structural components of molds are very delicate, they can be distorted very easily. So, the slide culture technique is used to minimize the chances of distortion.
* [Cultivation of molds on the solid surface](https://awesomeveterinary.blogspot.com/p/cultivation-of-molds-on-solid-surface.html) - Cultivation of molds on the solid is sometimes preffered when fungal colony morphology examination is required. Sometime fungi can be identified by observing their colony shape, apprearance and color.
* [Mycological staining ](https://awesomeveterinary.blogspot.com/p/mycological-staining.html) - The most common mycological stain is lactophenol blue. Methylene blue can also be used.
* [Microbiological tests for Bacterial classification or identification](https://awesomeveterinary.blogspot.com/p/microbiological-tests-for-bacterial.html) - These tests are used to classify bacteria.
