* [Simple staining](https://awesomeveterinary.blogspot.com/p/simple-staining.html) - In the simple staining bacterial smear is stained with a single reagent, which produce distinctive contrast between an organism and its background. Basic stains with a positively charged chromogen are preferred because bacterial nuclei and cell wall are negatively charged. That charge will ultimately result in a strong binding with the positively charged chromogen. Purpose of staining is to visualize the morphology and arrangement of the bacterial cells.
* [Negative staining](https://awesomeveterinary.blogspot.com/p/negative-staining.html) - Negative staining require the use of an acidic stain such as India ink or nigrosin. The acidic stain is a negatively charged chromogen that cannot penetrate into bacterial cell due to the negative charge on the surface of bacterial cells. Therefore, unstained cells are easily visible against the colored background. Negative stain has two advantages. First, as heat fixation is not done and the cells are not subjected to any chemical or heat distortion so we can observe natural shape and size of bacterial cells. Secondly, we can easily observe the bacterial cells that are difficult to visualize.

For flagella staining best is to use fresh young culture.
* [Spore staining](https://awesomeveterinary.blogspot.com/p/spore-staining.html) - Bacterial endospores formed by the genera Clostridium and Bacillus possess remarkable resistance to physical and chemical agents. Spore do not absorb the stain easily but once stained it does not lose it easily. Heat is applied to force the spores to get stain. When cooled the will not lose it even when during washing. These remarkable features are due to presence of dipicolinic acid.
