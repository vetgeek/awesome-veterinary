### Laboratory diagnosis
* [Laboratory diagnosis](https://awesomeveterinary.blogspot.com/p/blog-page_14.html) - Laboratory diagnosis is the examination of the diseases in laboratory by using chemicals, microscope and many other new advanced instruments.

### Pathology
* [Pathology](https://awesomeveterinary.blogspot.com/p/blog-page_71.html) - Pathology is that branch of medicine that deals with study of causes and effects of diseases. The word Pathology  also refers to the study of diseases and forensic examination of animals.
* [Antemoretm and post mortem inspection of food animals](https://awesomeveterinary.blogspot.com/p/antemortem-and-post-moortem-inspection.html) - It is for the surity of health animals.
* [Carcass judgement for safe and healthy meat](https://awesomeveterinary.blogspot.com/p/carcass-judgement.html) - It is for the surity of healthy meat.
* [Species identification](https://awesomeveterinary.blogspot.com/p/species-identification.html) - It is for the identification of different species of animals.
* [Post mortem examination of skull](https://awesomeveterinary.blogspot.com/p/post-mortem-examination-of-skull.html) - It is done to ensure that animal is not suffering from neurological diseases, rabies etc.
* [Avian necropsy](https://awesomeveterinary.blogspot.com/p/avian-necropsy.html) - This test is done to know the cause of disease, so that we can take preventive measures for rest of the flock.
* [How to write a post mortem report](https://awesomeveterinary.blogspot.com/p/blog-page_18.html) - This report is generated after the careful examination of culled or dead animals.
* [Specific diseases of animals (ruminants)](https://awesomeveterinary.blogspot.com/p/specific-diseases-of-animals.html) - It is necessory to diagnose animals for this diseases so that we can prevent zoonotic diseases.

### Histopathology
* [Histopathology](https://awesomeveterinary.blogspot.com/p/histopathology_22.html) - Histopathology is the diagnosis and study of diseases of the tissues, and involves examining tissues and/or cells under a microscope. Histopathologists are responsible for making tissue diagnoses and helping clinicians manage a patient's care.
* [Microscope](https://awesomeveterinary.blogspot.com/p/care-of-light-microscope.html) - It is used to see microscopic organisms.
* [Tissue preparation for microscopic study](https://awesomeveterinary.blogspot.com/p/tissue-preparation-for-microscopic-study.html) - We prepare tissue before examination under the microscope.
* [Preparation and staining of blood smear](https://awesomeveterinary.blogspot.com/p/blog-page_22.html) - We stain tissue in order to defferentiate cells.
* [Dye](https://awesomeveterinary.blogspot.com/p/dye.html) - Different dyes are used to stain tissues.

### Radiology
* [Radiology](https://awesomeveterinary.blogspot.com/p/radiology_16.html) - Radiology is the medical discipline that uses medical imaging to diagnose and treat diseases within the bodies of animals.
* [Introduction](https://awesomeveterinary.blogspot.com/p/introduction.html) - It is about radiology.
* [Radiographic technologies and basic principles](https://awesomeveterinary.blogspot.com/p/radiographic-terminology-and.html) - In this section we can get information about the latest technologies and their basic principles used in the radiology field.
* [X-ray](https://awesomeveterinary.blogspot.com/p/xray.html) - X-rays are strong electromagnetic radiations that are used to see the internal structures of the body.
* [Processing of x-ray film](https://awesomeveterinary.blogspot.com/p/processing-of-xray-film.html) - Films are used to print the images taken by radiographer.
* [Ultrasound](https://awesomeveterinary.blogspot.com/p/ultrasound.html) - The sound having frequency more than 20,000 Hz are called ultrasounds. These high frequency waves are used to see the internal structures.
* [Radiation hazards](https://awesomeveterinary.blogspot.com/p/radiation-hazards-and-safety-itis.html) - Radiations have damaging effects on living beings.
* [Contrast radiography](https://awesomeveterinary.blogspot.com/p/contrast-radiography.html) - When the radiodensity of the tissue itself or its surrounding structures is deliberately altered to obtain a radiograph with enhanced visualization and demarcation, it is called contrast radiography.

### Microbiology (veterinary bacteriology)
* [Microbiology (veterinary bacteriology)](https://awesomeveterinary.blogspot.com/p/microbiology.html) - Microbiology is the study of microscopic organisms, such as bacteria, viruses, fungi, archaea, and protozoa.
In this section you can get the information about how to culture and see micro-organisms. These procedures are helpful when a physician wants to know the nature and type of causative agent of a particular disease.
* [General rules and regulations](https://awesomeveterinary.blogspot.com/p/blog-page_15.html) - These rules are designed for the safety/protection of lab workers, animals, humans, and environment.
* [Equipements and laboratory materials used in microbiology](https://awesomeveterinary.blogspot.com/p/equipements-and-laboratory-materials.html) - In this section, you can get information about the tools and equipments used in the microbiology labs.
* [Use of Autoclave: Sterilization by moist heat](https://awesomeveterinary.blogspot.com/p/blog-page_13.html) - Microbial population is often controlled by the use of physical and chemical agents. Chemical agents includes various disinfectants and antiseptics. While physical agents such as temperature, osmotic pressure and radiations (gamma rays, cathode rays, X-rays and ultraviolet rays).
* [Use of hot air oven dry heat sterilization](https://awesomeveterinary.blogspot.com/p/use-of-hot-air-oven-dry-heat.html) - Equipments like laboratory glassware and metal ware are usually sterilized by hot air oven. It can produce upto 200°C temperature. For sterilization 171°C is used for 20-30 min. Dry heat usually destroys microbes by oxidation of their proteins and ultimately incineration.
* [Culture media](https://awesomeveterinary.blogspot.com/p/blog-page_79.html) - A culture media is the mixture of organic and inorganic substances in which microorganisms are grown. While the culture is any deliberate growth or cultivation of microorganisms in the laboratory.
* [Preparation of the culture media](https://awesomeveterinary.blogspot.com/p/preparation-of-culture-media.html) - Culture media are commercially available in dehydrated form. These contain all the ingredients required in exact proportion. We have to only rehydrate the media, according to the instructions of the manufacturers. These are sterilized and dispensed into test tubes and petri plates as required for the experimentation. Some of the well known manufacturers of the media are Oxoid Ltd (UK), BDH (UK), Merck (Germany), Sigma (USA), Difco corporation (USA), and BioM (USA).
* [Preparation of Bacterial Smear](https://awesomeveterinary.blogspot.com/p/preparation-of-bacterial-smear.html) - To study the microorganisms and their characteristic, we need a pure culture. A pure culture contains only a single kind of microorganisms. To obtain pure culture varius techniques can be adopted.
* [Simple staining](https://awesomeveterinary.blogspot.com/p/simple-staining.html) - In the simple staining bacterial smear is stained with a single reagent, which produce distinctive contrast between an organism and its background. Basic stains with a positively charged chromogen are preferred because bacterial nuclei and cell wall are negatively charged. That charge will ultimately result in a strong binding with the positively charged chromogen. Purpose of staining is to visualize the morphology and arrangement of the bacterial cells.
* [Negative staining](https://awesomeveterinary.blogspot.com/p/negative-staining.html) - Negative staining require the use of an acidic stain such as India ink or nigrosin. The acidic stain is a negatively charged chromogen that cannot penetrate into bacterial cell due to the negative charge on the surface of bacterial cells. Therefore, unstained cells are easily visible against the colored background. Negative stain has two advantages. First, as heat fixation is not done and the cells are not subjected to any chemical or heat distortion so we can observe natural shape and size of bacterial cells. Secondly, we can easily observe the bacterial cells that are difficult to visualize.
